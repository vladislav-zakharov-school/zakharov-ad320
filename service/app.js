/**
 * AS ALWAYS you will create a week9 branch to work on. You may work from the
 * current state of main in my repo. Incorrect submissions will lose points this
 * week.
 *
 * Each user should be assigned a role, and each role should be allowed to do
 * different things. There are many ways to handle roles and permissions, but
 * we'll keep it as simple as possible. Every call that should be restricted
 * should check the user and their role before allowing them to complete the
 * operation.
 *
 * Every call that needs to be restricted to certain users should require a
 * token to be authorized. Add a 'role' property to the user model limited to
 * one of three values: Admin, SuperUser, User.
 * - An admin should be able to call every route and without being rejected.
 * - A superuser should be able to get all users and users by id, add, update
 * and delete other users' decks and cards, but should not have permission to
 * update or delete OTHER user objects. They may update and delete their own
 * user profile.
 * - A user should only have access to create, update and delete their own cards
 * and decks. They should be able to update their own user data but NOT to
 * delete their own user account. They can choose to deactivate their own
 * account, but cannot reactivate it without admin assistance
 *
 * Based on these rules, you should restrict each route in the app that would be
 * affected by permissions
